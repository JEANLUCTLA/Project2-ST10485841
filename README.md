#  History Flashcard App 

##  Project Overview

Flashcards are a widely-used study tool that helps learners retain knowledge through active recall and repetition. This native Android app provides users with a simple, interactive way to study history using flashcards.

Users will be presented with five history-related questions. After answering each, the app calculates the user's score and provides feedback at the end of the quiz.
